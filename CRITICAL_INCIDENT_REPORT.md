# üö® CRITICAL INCIDENT REPORT - Mass Email Out-of-Office Bug

**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Mass email sending incident  
**Status**: EMERGENCY PATCHED (Auto-reply disabled)

## üìã Incident Summary

A critical race condition in the out-of-office auto-reply system caused **multiple automated emails to be sent to random recipients** when the system failed to properly track processed senders.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **Race Condition in Sender Tracking**
   - `processedSenders.has(email)` check happened BEFORE `processedSenders.add(email)`
   - Multiple emails from same sender could pass the check simultaneously
   - Concurrent processing with `forEach` instead of sequential processing

2. **Cache Invalidation Timing Bug**
   - `clearAutoReplyCache()` called when out-of-office status changed
   - This cleared `processedSenders` while emails were still being processed
   - Already-checked emails could be processed again after cache clear

3. **Inadequate Error Handling**
   - Failed auto-replies were caught but sender still marked as processed
   - Created inconsistent state between actual sends and tracking

4. **No Rate Limiting or Deduplication**
   - No cooldown period between replies to same sender
   - No atomic locking mechanism for email processing

### Code Locations:
- `src/services/emailService.ts` lines 441-447 (concurrent forEach)
- `src/services/emailService.ts` lines 95-105 (race condition check)
- `src/contexts/OutOfOfficeContext.tsx` line 52 (cache clearing)

## üö® Emergency Actions Taken

### Immediate Response:
1. **DISABLED AUTO-REPLY FUNCTIONALITY** in `emailService.ts`
2. **Added emergency console warnings** to prevent further automated sends
3. **Commented out processing loop** to stop any new auto-replies

### Code Changes:
- Modified email processing to skip auto-reply checks
- Added emergency disable flags and warnings
- Created incident documentation

## üìà Impact Assessment

- **Multiple recipients** received unexpected out-of-office emails
- **Recipients were "random"** - not logically connected
- **Reputation damage** potential due to spam-like behavior
- **Gmail API quota** potentially consumed rapidly

## üîß Required Fixes (DO NOT DEPLOY WITHOUT THESE)

### 1. Atomic Sender Processing
```typescript
// Add pending tracking to prevent race conditions
const pendingSenders = new Set<string>();

// Check both processed AND pending atomically
if (processedSenders.has(email) || pendingSenders.has(email)) {
  return;
}

// Lock immediately
pendingSenders.add(email);
```

### 2. Sequential Processing
```typescript
// Replace forEach with sequential for-loop
for (const email of unreadEmails) {
  await checkAndSendAutoReply(email);
}
```

### 3. Rate Limiting
```typescript
const lastReplyTimes = new Map<string, number>();
const REPLY_COOLDOWN_MS = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour

// Check cooldown before processing
const lastReply = lastReplyTimes.get(senderEmail);
if (lastReply && Date.now() - lastReply < REPLY_COOLDOWN_MS) {
  return;
}
```

### 4. Safer Cache Management
```typescript
// Don't clear cache during active processing
// Add processing counter to track active operations
let activeProcessingCount = 0;

export const clearAutoReplyCache = (): void => {
  if (activeProcessingCount > 0) {
    console.warn('Cache clear delayed - email processing in progress');
    return;
  }
  processedSenders.clear();
}
```

### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  await sendAutoReply();
  processedSenders.add(email); // Only mark as processed on SUCCESS
} catch (error) {
  // Log error but DON'T mark as processed
  console.error('Auto-reply failed:', error);
} finally {
  pendingSenders.delete(email); // Always clean up pending
}
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements Before Re-enabling

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Concurrent email processing scenarios
   - Cache clearing during processing
   - Error handling paths

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Multiple rapid out-of-office status changes
   - High-volume email processing
   - Network failure scenarios

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Simulate rapid email fetches
   - Test with 100+ unread emails
   - Verify rate limiting works

## üìä Monitoring Requirements

1. **Add Metrics**:
   - Auto-reply send count per hour
   - Failed auto-reply attempts
   - Cache clear frequency

2. **Add Alerts**:
   - More than 5 auto-replies per hour to same sender
   - Auto-reply error rate > 10%
   - Rapid cache clearing (sign of status toggling)

## üöÄ Recovery Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Fix code with all safety measures
2. **Phase 2**: Deploy with auto-reply STILL disabled
3. **Phase 3**: Enable logging-only mode (simulate sends)
4. **Phase 4**: Gradual re-enable with strict monitoring
5. **Phase 5**: Full functionality with enhanced monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

- **DO NOT re-enable auto-reply without ALL fixes implemented**
- **DO NOT deploy during high email volume periods**
- **DO NOT clear processedSenders cache unless system is idle**
- **MONITOR Gmail API quotas closely after re-enabling**

## üîê Prevention Measures

1. **Code Reviews**: All email-sending code requires 2+ reviewers
2. **Feature Flags**: Auto-reply should be feature-flagged
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement global email send rate limits
4. **Testing**: Require race condition testing for async operations
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time email send monitoring dashboard

---

**This incident demonstrates the critical importance of:**
- Atomic operations in concurrent systems
- Proper error handling in automated systems
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Comprehensive testing of race conditions

**Next Review Date**: Immediate - before any auto-reply re-enablement

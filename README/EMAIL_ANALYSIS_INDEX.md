## üîç Quick FAQ

### Q: What's the problem?
**A**: Emails stored in 26+ arrays with no sync. Same email can persist after deletion.  
**See**: EMAIL_QUICK_START.md (TL;DR section)

### Q: Why does trash show 24 instead of 12?
**A**: Cache stores globally, queries overlap, deduplication missing.  
**See**: EMAIL_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md (Data Flow section)

### Q: How do I fix it?
**A**: Choose from 3 paths (A/B/C). Path A recommended (15 min).  
**See**: EMAIL_QUICK_START.md (Fix Paths section)

### Q: Where exactly is the code?
**A**: Multiple locations. Service layer, component state, cache layer.  
**See**: EMAIL_CODE_LOCATIONS.md (File Map)

### Q: How long will the fix take?
**A**: Path A: 15 min | Path B: 25 min | Path C: 12 min  
**See**: EMAIL_QUICK_START.md (Comparison Table)

### Q: What if I choose wrong?
**A**: Easy to pivot. All paths are independent branches.  
**See**: EMAIL_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md (What NOT to do)

### Q: How do I verify it works?
**A**: Use reproduction steps + metrics monitoring.  
**See**: EMAIL_CODE_LOCATIONS.md (Reproduction + Metrics)

## üí° Key Insights

### The Core Issue
```
26+ parallel arrays + 1 broken cache = email duplication
Email in Gmail: 12
Email in App: 24
```

### The Fix Options
```
PATH A: Fix cache (15 min, low risk)
PATH B: Single master (25 min, best long-term)
PATH C: Better cache (12 min, quick win)
```

### The Success Metric
```
Before: Trash count ‚â† Gmail count
After: Trash count === Gmail count
```
